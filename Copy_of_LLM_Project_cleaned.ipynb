NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \\\"A tape was made, you saw that? With the airplane coming in \\u2026 and the money coming off, I guess,\\u201d he said while addressing supporters in Portland, Maine. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR At a campaign rally in Florida a day earlier, Trump for the first time said he had seen a video shot by Iran, \\u201ctaking that money off that airplane.\\u201d NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR But campaign officials later told CBS News that the video in question was actually footage of the released American hostages landing at Geneva, which had been aired on Fox News. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Even so, Trump repeated the claim in Maine, insisting that the video was made public by the Iranians to embarrass the United States. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \\\"They want to embarrass our country. And they want to embarrass our president,\\\" he said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Trump's campaign in recent days has been fueling allegations that the Obama administration paid $400 million in cash ransom to win the release of four Americans as part of the agreement implemented in January to restrict Iran's efforts to develop a nuclear weapon. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The administration has denied any ransom was paid, noting that it publicly disclosed the $400-million payment in January and that it was widely reported at the time. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The administration says the money was being returned to Iran after being frozen following the 1979 Iranian revolution. The payment was to partly settle Iran's legal claims arising from a weapons purchase from the U.S. that never took place. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Republicans and the Trump campaign have said the timing of the payment and use of cash give the appearance that the U.S. was paying ransom. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR At his rally on Thursday, Trump speculated that the money would be used by Iran to fund terrorism. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \\\"I wonder where that money really goes, by the way.... Well, it went either in their pockets, which I actually think more so, or toward terrorism -- probably a combination of both,\\u201d he said. ||||| Washington (CNN) Donald Trump backed off a false claim Friday morning, admitting he had not seen a video of a $400 million payment being unloaded from a US plane in Iran. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The Republican nominee had claimed at rallies twice this week that such a video existed, saying in Maine on Thursday that it was provided by Iranians \\\"to embarrass our president because we have a president who's incompetent.\\\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR What Trump had actually seen in news reports was video of three American prisoners who Iran had released arriving in Geneva, Switzerland. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Trump admitted his error in an early-morning tweet Friday, without actually saying he was wrong. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \\\"The plane I saw on television was the hostage plane in Geneva, Switzerland, not the plane carrying $400 million in cash going to Iran!\\\" he tweeted. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The plane I saw on television was the hostage plane in Geneva, Switzerland, not the plane carrying $400 million in cash going to Iran! NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR It was a rare reversal for Trump, who has stood by inaccurate or unproven claims previously -- insisting he'd seen videos of Muslim Americans in New Jersey cheering the September 11, 2001, attacks. His political rise began during the 2012 campaign, when he insisted that Obama release his birth certificate, questioning the President's American citizenship. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Democratic vice presidential nominee Tim Kaine hit Trump on Friday for the video claim, saying he seems \\\"confused\\\" on CBS' \\\"This Morning,\\\" in an interview taped before Trump backtracked. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \\\"I have no idea what he's talking about. It (the video) doesn't exist. He might be thinking about Iran Contra from like 35 years ago or something like this,\\\" Kaine said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR He pointed to Trump's recent criticism of Kaine, who Trump said in a late-July news conference \\\"did a terrible job in New Jersey\\\" -- despite Kaine being a governor and senator from Virginia, not New Jersey. Kaine said Trump must have confused him with Tom Kean, who was New Jersey's governor until 1990. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \\\"He was confusing it with a situation from two or three decades ago. Maybe that's what he's doing with this bogus video claim,\\\" Kaine said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Asked if he thinks Trump is confused, Kaine said: \\\"I absolutely think he's confused.\\\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Paul Manafort, Trump's campaign chairman, responded to Kaine on Fox News Friday morning, saying he's \\\"not sure there was confusion\\\" on Trump's part. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \\\"The point that he was making is the cash-transfer took place and it was taking place consistent with the transfer of hostages,\\\" Manafort said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \\\"Again, what the Obama administration wants to do is get off of the point. The point is, $400 million in cash that most likely ended up in terrorist camps used against the west was given in exchange for hostages and the President of the United States lied to the American people, that's the point.\\\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Trump has made criticism of the US delivery of $400 million in cash via a plane to Iran -- the first installment of $1.7 billion in payments related to a decades-old dispute over an unfulfilled us arms purchase before the Iranian revolution cut relations between the two countries and settled at the same time Iran released four American prisoners -- a staple this week on the campaign trail. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR But Wednesday in Florida and Thursday in Maine, he went a step further, claiming he'd seen video of the cash actually being delivered in Iran. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \\\"It was interesting because a tape was made. Right? You saw that? With the airplane coming in -- nice plane -- and the airplane coming in, and the money coming off, I guess. Right? That was given to us, has to be, by the Iranians,\\\" Trump said in Portland, Maine. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \\\"And you know why the tape was given to us? Because they want to embarrass our country. They want to embarrass our country. And they want to embarrass our president because we have a president who's incompetent. They want to embarrass our president,\\\" Trump said. \\\"I mean, who would ever think they would be taking all of this money off the plane and then providing us with a tape? It's only for one reason. And it's very, very sad.\\\" ||||| Starting in 1996, Alexa Internet has been donating their crawl data to the Internet Archive.

According to reporting from Agence France-Presse (AFP) and other news agencies, the payment resolved a deadlock at the Iran-U.S. Claims Tribunal that had stood since the tribunal\\u2019s inception in 1981, and represented \\u201ca broader clearing of the decks between the old foes\\u201d just one day after the signing of an historic nuclear agreement.

Wooden pallets stacked with euros, Swiss francs and other currencies were flown into Iran on an unmarked cargo plane, according to these officials. The U.S. procured the money from the central banks of the Netherlands and Switzerland, they said. The money represented the first installment of a $1.7 billion settlement the Obama administration reached with Iran to resolve a decades-old dispute over a failed arms deal signed just before the 1979 fall of Iran\\u2019s last monarch, Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi.

[...] Meanwhile, U.S. officials have said they were certain Washington was going to lose the arbitration in The Hague, where Iran was seeking more than $10 billion, and described the settlement as a bargain for taxpayers. [...] The $400 million was paid in foreign currency because any transaction with Iran in U.S. dollars is illegal under U.S. law. Sanctions also complicate Tehran\\u2019s access to global banks. [...] The Iranians were demanding the return of $400 million the Shah\\u2019s regime deposited into a Pentagon trust fund in 1979 to purchase U.S. fighter jets, U.S. officials said.

Robert F. McDonnell and his sister last year, and the governor did not disclose the money as a gift or loan, according to people with knowledge of the payments. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The donor, wealthy businessman Jonnie R. Williams Sr., also gave a previously unknown $50,000 check to the governor\\u2019s wife, Maureen, in 2011, the people said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The money to the corporation and Maureen McDonnell brings to $145,000 the amount Williams gave to assist the McDonnell family in 2011 and 2012 \\u2014 funds that are now at the center of federal and state investigations. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Williams, the chief executive of dietary supplement manufacturer Star Scientific Inc., also provided a $10,000 check in December as a present to McDonnell\\u2019s eldest daughter, Jeanine, intended to help defray costs at her May 2013 wedding, the people said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Virginia\\u2019s first family already is under intense scrutiny for accepting $15,000 from the same chief executive to pay for the catering at the June 2011 wedding of Cailin McDonnell at the Executive Mansion. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR View Graphic Timeline: Star Scientific and Gov. McDonnell NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR All the payments came as McDonnell and his wife took steps to promote the donor\\u2019s company and its products. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The payments to the corporation, confirmed by people familiar with the transactions, offer the first public example of money provided by Williams that would directly benefit the governor and not just his family. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The money went from a trust, controlled by Williams, to MoBo Real Estate Partners, a limited-liability corporation formed in 2005 by McDonnell and his sister, the sources said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR McDonnell viewed the payments to MoBo and to his wife as loans and not gifts, according to three people familiar with the transactions. State law requires elected officials to disclose their personal loans but not loans made to their corporate interests. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Tucker Martin, a spokesman for the governor, declined to comment on the payments other than to say that McDonnell has been diligent in filling out legally mandated disclosures. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \\u201cThe rules that I\\u2019m following have been rules that have been in place for decades,\\u201d McDonnell said Tuesday on a Norfolk radio show. \\u201cThese have been the disclosure rules of Virginia. I\\u2019m following those. To, after the fact, impose some new requirements on an official when you haven\\u2019t kept record of other gifts given to family members or things like that obviously wouldn\\u2019t be fair.\\u201d NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR State law requires the disclosure of any gift valued at more than $50, but gifts to family members are exempt. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Jerry Kilgore, an attorney for Williams, declined to comment on the payments. A spokesman for the U.S. attorney investigating the payments also declined to comment. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR On state-mandated disclosure forms, McDonnell indicated that a member of his immediate family owed money to an unnamed individual creditor in 2011 and 2012. In one year, he described the creditor as someone in \\u201cmedical services.\\u201d In the other year, the governor said the creditor was in \\u201chealth care.\\u201d Star Scientific makes nutritional supplements. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The form did not specify the exact amount owed; the governor checked a box saying it was between $10,001 and $50,000. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The people familiar with the payments, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of state and federal investigations of the governor, differed on whether any kind of payment plan had been established to reimburse Williams. They agreed that none of the money to the corporation or Maureen McDonnell has been repaid. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Revelations of the additional payments came as a federal grand jury was scheduled to hear testimony in the case this week. Separately, state prosecutors in Richmond are looking into whether the governor has complied with all disclosure laws. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR McDonnell has said that Star Scientific received no special benefits from his administration and that any actions he or his wife took to boost the company were standard for any administration promoting state-based enterprises. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The $145,000 in payments from Williams came in addition to other undisclosed gifts that Williams gave to the governor\\u2019s family, including $15,000 in luxury clothing he bought for Maureen McDonnell and a $6,500 Rolex watch she asked him to purchase so she could give it to her husband. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR McDonnell has disclosed receiving $9,650 in gifts from Williams, including private plane trips and the use of a summer lake-house vacation. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Wedding catering NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Williams\\u2019s first payment to the McDonnell family came in a $50,000 check made out to Maureen McDonnell from his trust on May 23, 2011, the people familiar with the transactions said. That was the same day Williams wrote a separate check for the catering at Cailin McDonnell\\u2019s wedding. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Then, in March 2012, Williams wrote a $50,000 check from his trust to MoBo, which was followed by an additional $20,000 payment to the corporation that spring, the people said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In annual financial-disclosure forms, McDonnell has indicated that he owns a stake in MoBo, which he reported was associated with two Virginia Beach rental properties he purchased in 2005 and 2006 with his wife and his sister, who is also named Maureen. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The name of MoBo, formed in 2005, apparently comes from the combination of the names \\u201cMaureen\\u201d and \\u201cBob\\u201d and is the entity that makes mortgage payments on the homes and pays for the properties\\u2019 renovations and upkeep. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Virginia law allows elected officials to accept gifts of any size, including money, provided they annually disclose those worth at least $50. The law does not require the disclosure of gifts given to members of an elected official\\u2019s immediate family, nor gifts provided by relatives or \\u201cpersonal friends.\\u201d NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR McDonnell has said he considers Williams, whom he met shortly before his 2009 campaign for governor, to be a \\u201cfamily friend.\\u201d He has said the catering at the 2011 wedding was a gift to his daughter and did not need to be disclosed. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR State law requires officials to disclose loans made to them and members of their immediate family. But it does not require elected officials to spell out their business liabilities. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR One person familiar with MoBo\\u2019s finances indicated that corporate records show the governor and his sister agreed to a low-interest loan with Williams. Terms of the loan dictated that they would make no payments for three years but return the $70,000 by 2015. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR That person indicated that MoBo had trouble keeping up with expenses after the collapse of the real estate market and had accepted three previous loans, two from McDonnell\\u2019s family in 2007 and 2008 and another from a family friend in 2010. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR He indicated that the loan to the family friend has been satisfied and the loans from the family member have been partially repaid. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The payments came as Maureen McDonnell told friends that the first couple was facing financial stress, two people said, in part because of difficulty renting the beach houses. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The governor, his wife and sister purchased one of the homes for $1.15 million in 2005 and the other for $850,000 in 2006. According to assessments, the beach properties have declined in value since the McDonnells purchased them during a red-hot real estate market. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In his annual financial disclosures, the governor has also indicated an ownership stake in another rental property: at the Wintergreen mountain resort in central Virginia, purchased for $1 million in 2007. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Also, the first couple bought a $835,000 house in the Richmond suburbs in 2006, where they were living until they moved to the state\\u2019s 200-year-old Executive Mansion when McDonnell became governor in 2010. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Consulting payment alleged NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR As governor, McDonnell is paid $175,000 a year. His wife is not paid by the state for her volunteer work as first lady. However, the chief executive of a coal company recently said he paid her $36,000 last year to attend two or three meetings and act as a consultant to his company and family\\u2019s charitable efforts. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The governor has said Star Scientific received no government contracts, economic incentives or grants. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR However, the company was allowed to use the governor\\u2019s mansion to hold a luncheon to mark the launch of a new product in August 2011. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR A few weeks before, Maureen McDonnell arranged and attended a meeting between Williams and a top state official during which the executive presented new research about the potential health benefits of the supplement, Anatabloc, and proposed that Virginia consider examining whether its use could reduce health-care costs in the state. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR And Virginia Secretary of Health Bill Hazel said for the first time last week that he also met one-on-one with Williams in 2010 so the chief executive could pitch Star Scientific. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Hazel said the meeting came at the urging of someone in the governor\\u2019s or first lady\\u2019s office, but he could not remember which. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR He said such meetings are not unusual. He concluded that Williams\\u2019s product was \\u201cnot ready for prime time\\u201d and said he was confident that Williams received no benefit from the meeting.

The operation was targeting ISIS-K, the terrorist group's Afghanistan affiliate. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Achin District is the primary base of operations for ISIS in Afghanistan and has been the site of multiple joint US-Afghan counterterrorism missions.

At a rally Wednesday in Daytona Beach, Fla., Trump claimed the \\\"military tape\\\" purportedly showing \\\"money pouring off a plane\\\" had been released by Iran to \\\"embarrass\\\" the US. He again voiced the claim about the video during a Thursday rally in Portland, Maine, adding that Iran hoped to personally embarrass an \\\"incompetent\\\" President Obama with the video, the Los Angeles Times and CNN report. His remarks caused a temporary hubbub, as some speculated that perhaps he had seen a classified video during security briefings afforded to presidential nominees. But what Trump had actually seen soon came to light: \\\"b-roll footage,\\\" his spokeswoman emailed the Post, that had been playing behind news reports. It showed not a money swap but an AP clip of three US prisoners released by Iran and arriving in Geneva on Jan. 17. That led Trump to point out his own error on Twitter on Friday morning (though CNN notes he did so \\\"without actually saying he was wrong\\\"): \\\"The plane I saw on television was the hostage plane in Geneva, Switzerland, not the plane carrying $400 million in cash going to Iran!\\\" he tweeted.\",\n          \"\\u2013 The investigation into the relationship between Virginia Gov.
